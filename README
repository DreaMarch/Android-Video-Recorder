Android Video Recorder

A simple library using ffmpeg, libx264, and libfaac to record videos on Android.
Tested with Android NDK r6b.
Targeted to armv7-a with vfpv3-d16.

How To Build

1. Make directories faac, x264, and ffmpeg, and place the sources for them into the respective directories.
2. Run /path/to/android/ndk/build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh --install-dir=./toolchain
3. Edit build.sh and change NDK at the top to point to your NDK directory.
4. Run the following commands:
	./build.sh config faac
	./build.sh compile faac
	./build.sh config x264
	./build.sh compile x264
	./build.sh config ffmpeg
	./build.sh compile ffmpeg
	./build.sh compile recorder
5. You should now have a static library libVideoRecorder.a.

How To Use

Link libVideoRecorder.a into your Android JNI as a prebuilt static library.
Use the interface given in VideoRecorder.h in your JNI C++ code.
